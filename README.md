[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timofurrer/w1thermsensor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/timofurrer/w1thermsensor)

*Author*: Timo Furrer <tuxtimo@gmail.com><br>
*Version*: 0.2.2

## Supported devices

The following w1 therm sensor devices are supported:

* DS18S20
* DS1822
* DS18B20

## Setup

You just need a w1 therm sensor. <br>
Some of them can be bought here: [Adafruit: DS18B20](https://www.adafruit.com/search?q=DS18B20) <br>
I've used a Raspberry Pi with an GPIO Breakout (Pi Cobbler)

## Installation

### From Source

    git clone https://github.com/danger89/w1thermsensor.git && cd w1thermsensor
    python setup.py install

*Note: maybe root privileges are required*

### From PIP

    pip install w1thermsensor

*Note: maybe root privileges are required*

## Usage

The usage is very simple and the interface clean..
All examples are with the `DS18B20` sensor - It works the same way for the other supported devices.

### Basic usage with one sensor (implicit)

```python
from w1thermsensor import W1ThermSensor

sensor = W1ThermSensor()
temperature_in_celsius = sensor.get_temperature()
temperature_in_fahrenheit = sensor.get_temperature(W1ThermSensor.DEGREES_F)
temperature_in_all_units = sensor.get_temperatures([W1ThermSensor.DEGREES_C, W1ThermSensor.DEGREES_F, W1ThermSensor.KELVIN])
```

The need kernel modules will be automatically loaded in the constructor of the `W1ThermSensor` class. <br>
If something went wrong an exception is raised.

*The first found sensor will be taken*

### Basic usage with one sensor (explicit)

The DS18B20 sensor with the ID `00000588806a` will be taken.

```python
from w1thermsensor import W1ThermSensor

sensor = W1ThermSensor(W1ThermSensor.THERM_SENSOR_DS18B20, "00000588806a")
temperature_in_celsius = sensor.get_temperature()
```

### Multiple sensors

With the `get_available_sensors` class-method you can get the ids of all available sensors.

```python
from w1thermsensor import W1ThermSensor

for sensor in W1ThermSensor.get_available_sensors():
    print("Sensor %s has temperature %.2f" % (sensor.id, sensor.get_temperature()))
```

Only sensors of a specific therm sensor type:

```python
from w1thermsensor import W1ThermSensor

for sensor in W1ThermSensor.get_available_sensors([W1ThermSensor.THERM_SENSOR_DS18B20]):
    print("Sensor %s has temperature %.2f" % (sensor.id, sensor.get_temperature()))
```
